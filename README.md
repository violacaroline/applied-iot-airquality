### Short Project Overview

I built a web thing that measures the temperature and humidity of its surroundings, when humidity reaches over a beyond sweaty level a red LED lamp will turn on and when it reaches a level beyond, beyond sweaty it will blink! There is also a gas sensor detecting hazardous gases in our appartment, it could potentially be used as a breathalyzer, but I have only been sitting here waving alcogel in its face - which it sure does detect, and when it does it will turn on a LED to let you know. You can also control the microcontrollers onboard LED via the MQTT brokers UI.

The data collected by it is sent with MQTT to Adafruit and displayed in a dashboard. 

### Estimated Time to Complete Project

3 working days, with some time for the unexpected stuff life (read: software) throws at you.

### Objective

#### **Why did I choose this project?**

I chose this project because I found it interesting to see what was in the air of our apartment along with temperature and humidity, however, the MQ135 sensor is quite complicated and there is a need for calibration to see actual values of gases around. I'm using the digital output only, which is more of a yes/no if it detects gas or not.

#### **What purpose does it serve?**

With the DHT22 I measure the temperature and humidity of my island home at Isla Mujeres, Mexico. I also use the MQ135 sensor to detect gases such as NH3, NOx, Alcohol, Benzene, Smoke and CO2

#### **What insights will it give?**

How very, very hot the summer months here in the carribean really is. 

Jokes aside, purely data wise I had no idea that it was so much more humid here than Sweden, more than the double at over 70% compared to some of the measurements done by fellow students back home. It will also show wether or not our appartment contains any hazardous gases you normally would not want there! Which would have us take the necessary steps to remove them.

Also aside from what the project itself does and collects data about - it has given me insights into electrical circuits and components used for minor IoT projects, along with protocols and how parts interact with each other. From firmware being installed on Pico, to code uploaded on the Pico and then connectivity with wifi to get the data over to Adafruit.

#### **Raspberry Pi Pico W**

I am using the Raspberry Pi Pico W which is an affordable, wireless-enabled microcontroller board. It offers GPIO pins, programmability in C/C++ & MicroPython, and supports various interfaces (ex. SPI, 12C, UART). It is compact and offer wireless connectivity, power efficiency, and community support (RP2040 Raspberry Pi community) making it a good choice for a wide range of IoT applications, from home automation and sensor monitoring to remote control projects etc.

![Pico W](images/pico-w.png)

#### **Breadboard 830 points**

I opted for an 830-point breadboard as a physical base for my project. It offers ample space, compatibility and is affordable. It accommodates my numerous components and simplifies the circuit connections.

![Breadboard 830 points](images/breadboard.png)

#### **Male/Male Jumper Wires**

I work with Male-to-Male jumper wires which have connectors at both ends, allowing to establish quick and temporary connections between components on the breadboard or between pins. They are versatile, flexible, and simplify circuit building, making them ideal for rapid prototyping, experimenting, and connecting components without soldering or permanent connections.

![Male-Male Jumper Wires](images/jumper-wires.png)

#### **10kohm Resistors**

For the DHT22 sensor a resistor between 4.7-10kohm was recommended for communication between the sensor and microcontroller. It sets the default voltage level when the data line is not actively transmitting data and ensures reliable signal transmission and accurate readings.

![10kohm Resistors](images/10kohm-resistor.png)

#### **DHT22 Sensor**

I am working with the DHT22 sensor that measures temperature and humidity. It provides accurate, reliable readings and is easy to use with microcontrollers making it suitable for applications such as home automation, weather stations, and environmental monitoring.

![Dht22 Sensor](images/dht22.png)

#### **MQ135 Sensor (front)**

I am also using the MQ135 sensor that detects various gases, including air quality parameters like CO2, NH3, and harmful substances. It can monitor indoor air quality, pollution levels, and gas leakage ensuring safe and healthy living environments. It would need to be calibered properly to see real amounts of gases, I merely use it as Yes/No detects some gas.

![MQ135 Sensor](images/mq135-front.png)

#### **MQ135 Sensor (back)**

![MQ135 Sensor](images/mq135-back.png)

#### **LEDs**

LEDs allows for visual feedback, status indicators and creative lighting effects leading to a visually appealing experience and user interaction. They are very energy efficient, semiconducting (made of materials inbetween that of conductors and insulators) devices emiting light when electric current passes through them.

![LEDs](images/leds.png)


### Computer setup

#### **Chosen IDE**

For this project I have chosen to use Visual Studio Code as my Integrated Development Environment. I have this IDE installed on my computer since before, but if you don't you can download it from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

#### **Node.js**

For the extension Pymakr you will need nodejs installed on your computer. If you dont already have nodejs installed you can download and install it here: https://nodejs.org/es/download

#### **Flashing Pico**

The Pico W will need the micropython firmware installed on it.

Download the UF2 file from here: https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/

You can then proceed to press the onboard bootsel button (placing the Pico W in download mode) while connecting the microcontroller to the computer. When the drive/file explorer (RPI-RP2) opens you can release the bootsel button and drag and drop the previously downloaded UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2, upon which the Pico will reboot and now run micropython

#### **Extensions**

To interact with the Pico I am using the extension "Pymakr" which you can find by searching for it under the "Extensions" tab on the left hand side of VSCode:

![Extensions VSCode](/images/extension-btn-vsc.png)

#### **How the code is uploaded**

To be able to actually run the code you write in VSCode you need to upload it to the Pico W first.
This extensions simplifies the development and provides several tools like a user friendly means to manage the device connection, uploading the project to the Pico and access to a REPL console. It will show up on the left hand side of your VSCode like such:

![Pymakr VSCode](/images/pymakr-btn-vsc.png)

Whilst having your device connected to the computer via USB, click on the symbol for Pymakr shown above and a new tab will show. If you hover over the specific serial usb port there is a symbol in the form of a lightning which says "Connect device" - go ahead and press it. You will then connect to the Pico and can now upload you project or run/stop your script directly via the VSCode UI:

![Upload project](/images/pymakr-upload-project.png)

You can then create a REPL terminal by pressing the play button shown below and the main script should run automatically - if not, use execfile("main.py") as visible in the screenshot.

![Run project](/images/pymakr-run-script.png)

To stop the script you either press ctrl C in the REPL or press the 3 dots in the photo above and select "Stop script"

#### **Steps that you needed to do for your computer. Installation of Node.js, extra drivers, etc.**

For the IoT part I had what I needed already installed. When it comes to the presentation and handling of data I went through quite a few problems and different ideas of how to handle it. Initially, I wanted to use the ELK-stack and therefor downloaded the software needed from here:

Elastic Search: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.8/install-elasticsearch.html
Kibana: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/8.8/install.html
Logstash: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/8.8/installing-logstash.html

Then, when I had an issue with Kibana that I did not manage to solve I got the idea of building my own platform! An API and a client visualizing the data in charts and I could also take the oppurtunity and do it in a new language - namely dotnet. Which I then downloaded from here:

Dotnet: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download


### Putting everything together

To put everything together I am using my 830 point breadboard as a base to facilitate and to make everything more stable. 

On one side I have pushed down the Pico W and on the other I have the two sensors that I am using along with two external LED's. The Pico W power (pin number 36, 3V3) and ground (pin number 38) are connected to the rails on one side of the breadboard allowing me to connect other entities to power and ground via the rails.

The DHT sensor is then - aside from VCC to the power/plus rail and ground to the ground/minus rail - connected with the data/signal pin of the sensor to the Pico W GPIO 22 (pin number 29).

The MQ135 sensor is aside from power and ground to the rails, connected via its analog pin to the ADC pin of the Pico (analog digital converter) GPIO28 or pin number 34. The digital pin of the sensor is connected to GPIO 21 (pin number 27).

Then I have two LED's. These are connected with the anode (longer lead, positive) to GPIO 10 & 14 respectively (pin number 14 & 19) and with the cathode (shorter lead, negative) to GND on pin number 13 & 18 respectively.

![Hardware setup](/images/hardware-setup.jpg)

#### **Circuit Diagram**

![Fritzing Circuit Diagram](/images/applied-iot-fritzing-correct-circuit.png)

#### **Electrical Calculations**

Since my LED's operate on 2.1V and my Pico W on 3.3V I need to "drop" 1.2V. It can be done using resistors, to calculate the resistance I use Ohm's law. You then take: 

Voltage Source 3.3 - Voltage LED 2.1 
= 1.2

1.2 / 0.02 (20 milliamps)
= **60**

A resistor of 60ohms would be perfect. Unfortunately, I, at the time of this project only possessed 10kohm which ultimately made the LED emit only a tiny bit of light. I had many LED's to spare and simply wanted to see what happened if I connect it without a resistor. It worked fine so I let it be as such.

### Platform

#### **Adafruit**

I'm using Adafruit to display the data collected by the Pico. It is a cloud service and I have set up what they call a Group, which is a group of feeds representing the different datas/objects it receives/send data from/to (temperature, humidity, airquality, LED). By using a group it let's me send the data as one json object with an inner field of "feeds" which has key value pairs representing the specific feed for that kind of data i.e. "Temperature": tempData, etc. The version im using is free and I intend to keep it that way since it is enough for what I want to do. Payed versions would offer the ability to have more groups, feeds and dashboards etc.


#### **Own implemented API and dotnet Blazor frontend**

I also implemented my own platform. My Pico W will post data via MQTT to Adafruit, I then let my API request the data available in Adafruits API, it will transform the data to what I need for the client and this client will then display the data in a pie and line chart. I chose to do this for my own challenge and also learn a bit about a new programming language.

#### **Explain and elaborate what made you choose this platform (advanced)**

I chose the Adafruit platform due to it's simple setup and ability to show data and also possibly integrate it with other platforms. It is also a womanled company which I liked! Scaling the idea could involve Adafruits integration with other platforms such as IFTT (If This Then That) to automate actions based on the data collected. Which leaves my project open to extension!

Now, as mentioned, Adafruit was not my orignal choice. I wanted to use the ELK-stack due to the querying power that Elastic Search offers and also I have heard it is an attractive knowledge to have. I dont have loads and loads of different data, but Elastic essentially offers a really flexible way of querying the exact data you want, which can be a real advantage when the data is growing into Big Data. Here is a screen shot of the data in my elastic search instance's temperature index. This data was injected using Postman when testing my own built dotnet API:

![Data in my elastic search](/images/elastic-data-temp-index.png)

My own built platform, was merely a decision of wanting to try an unfamiliar programming language and I do believe the implementation of it enhanced my understanding of the responsibilities of the parts involved as well as the options of ways to do this!

Project Client: https://github.com/violacaroline/applied-iot-client

#### **Connecting to WIFI**

I connect to my local WIFI via the boot.py file which is run automatically on th Pico W's boot up (when starting). Typically, you would place any kind of logic or config needed to successfully run your main, therefor you can allow it to handle your network configuration.

Inside the function, it first checks if the device is already connected to a network. 
If not, it proceeds with the connection process.
It activates the Wi-Fi interface and attempts to connect to the specified network using the provided SSID and password.
While the device is not connected to the network, it repeatedly tries to connect with a one-second delay between attempts to give some time for the process before checking the connection status again.
Once the device is successfully connected, it prints a message confirming the connection and displays the network configuration details.

boot.py:

```
import network, time
from env_variables import ENV_VARIABLES 

def connect(SSID, SSID_PASSWORD):
    sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    if not sta_if.isconnected():
        print('Connecting to network...')
        sta_if.active(True)
        sta_if.connect(SSID, SSID_PASSWORD)
        while not sta_if.isconnected():
            print("Attempting to connect....")
            time.sleep(1)
    print('Connected! Network config:', sta_if.ifconfig())

connect(ENV_VARIABLES['SSID'], ENV_VARIABLES['SSID_PASSWORD'])

```

#### **Send data to group on Adafruit**

Due to having all relevant feeds in the same group on Adafruit I can send the data as one single object with an inner field of "feeds". Adafruit will then use each key in the object and match it to the corresponding feed in the group on the platform - instead of having to send it separately.

```
    if (time.time() - last_publish) >= publish_interval:
        sensorData = {
            'feeds': {
                'Temperature': temp,
                'Humidity': humidity,
                'Airquality': digital_air_quality_value
            }
        }

        payload = json.dumps(sensorData)
        
        mqttClient.publish(TOPIC_TEMP_HUMIDITY_AIRQUALITY_LED, payload.encode())
        
        last_publish = time.time()
        print('Published!')

```

The code snippet below is from my own built dotnet API. When a request comes from the client, I there query the data from one of the feeds in Adafruit, transform it and then only return what the client needs - the values themselves.

```
  // Create an instance of HttpClient to make the HTTP request
  var httpClient = new HttpClient();

  var apiUrl =
  "https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/CarolineA/feeds/temperature-and-humidity-and-airquality-and-led.humidity/data";
  this.apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ADAFRUIT_API_KEY");

  var requestUrl = $"{apiUrl}?X-AIO-Key={this.apiKey}";

  var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(requestUrl);

  // Read the response content as a string
  var data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

  var jsonObject = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<dynamic>(data);

  var values = new List<double>();

  foreach (var dataPoint in jsonObject.EnumerateArray())
  {
    var humidityData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<HumidityData>(dataPoint.GetRawText());

    string formattedValue = humidityData.value.Replace('.', ',');

    double value = double.Parse(formattedValue);

    values.Add(value);
  }
  return values;
```

The following code snippet is from my Dotnet Blazor Client. It retreives the necessary data from my API and then just seperates the values (1's and 0's) to their respective list, I can then give a visual representation of how often gas has been encountered in the sensor's surroundings.

```
  List<int> listOfOnes = new List<int>();
  List<int> listOfZeros = new List<int>();

  List<int> airQualityList = await this.GetPieData();

  // Loop through the airQualityList and populate the respective lists
  foreach (var dataPoint in airQualityList)
  {
    if (dataPoint == 1)
    {
      listOfOnes.Add(dataPoint);
    }
    else
    {
      listOfZeros.Add(dataPoint);
    }
  }
```

### Transmitting the Data / Connectivity

#### **How often is the data sent?**

The data is published to Adafruit every 5 seconds (there seems to be a slight latency at times).

#### **Which wireless protocols did you use (WiFi, LoRa, etc ...)?**

I am using WiFi.

#### **Which transport protocols were used (MQTT, webhook, etc ...)**

I am using the MQTT protocol to transfer the data in JSON to Adafruit.

```
  sensorData = {
    'feeds': {
      'Temperature': temp,
      'Humidity': humidity,
      'Airquality': digital_air_quality_value
    }
  }

  payload = json.dumps(sensorData)
  
  mqttClient.publish(TOPIC_TEMP_HUMIDITY_AIRQUALITY_LED, payload.encode())

```

First I create an object with a feeds key as specified by Adafruit, I then give that the necessary key value pairs for the data and transform it to JSON before publishing using the mqttClient. The mqttClient is prepared as such:

```
# Set up MQTT_BROKER info to connect
CLIENT_ID = ubinascii.hexlify(machine.unique_id()) # To create an MQTT client, we need to get the PICOW unique ID
MQTT_BROKER = 'io.adafruit.com' # MQTT broker IP address or DNS  
PORT = ENV_VARIABLES['PORT']
ADAFRUIT_USERNAME = ENV_VARIABLES['ADAFRUIT_USERNAME']
ADAFRUIT_PASSWORD = ENV_VARIABLES['ADAFRUIT_PASSWORD']

mqttClient = MQTTClient(CLIENT_ID, MQTT_BROKER, PORT, ADAFRUIT_USERNAME, ADAFRUIT_PASSWORD, keepalive=60)
mqttClient.set_callback(subscription_callback) # whenever a new message comes (to picoW), print the topic and message (The call back function will run whenever a message is published on a topic that the PicoW is subscribed to.)
mqttClient.connect()
mqttClient.subscribe(TOPIC_LED)
print(f'Connected to MQTT  Broker :: {MQTT_BROKER}, waiting for callback function to be called!')

```

#### **Which information models were used (WoT TD, Fiware,** etc...)

Im not using an information model.

#### ***Elaborate on the design choices regarding data transmission and wireless protocols. That is how your choices affect the device range and battery consumption.**

In my case WiFi is good for what I need. The sensors are located in my own apartment and there is no need for long range connectivity. Ultimately, the difference would be that WiFi offers me greater bandwith, but shorter range whereas for example LoRa offers great range, but lower bandwith. WiFi consumes more power compared to for example bluetooth, but it does offer me a bit more flexibility range wise. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for machine-to-machine communication. It operates over TCP/IP and can work efficiently even with limited bandwidth and low-power devices. MQTT's publish-subscribe model reduces unnecessary data transfers, which can conserve battery power and extend device range. However, I only use MQTT inbetween the device and Adafruit, there could actually be some real advantages in implementing MQTT communication between my API and Adafruit too. At the moment I am using HTTP to retreive data via Adafruits REST API. I could potentially have my API subscribe to the topics on Adafruit and as such receive data real time. It would also reduce network overhead and lower power consumption as well as enhance scalability, I could set up many clients that subscribe to that data and receive it simultaneously. This choice was most about my familarity with the techniques, besides, for the real-time-data to make perfect sense there should be a persistent connection between my API and the client too, which calls for yet another technology, like websocket and quickly the implementation turned more complex and unfamiliar.

### Presenting the data

#### **Provide visual examples of how the dashboard looks. Pictures needed.**

Below you can see a screenshot of the Adafruit dashboard I created:

![Adafruit dashboard](/images/adafruit-dashboard.png)

And some images from my own client:

![Dotnet Blazor App, pie chart](/images/blazor-pie-chart.png)

![Dotnet Blazor App, line chart](/images/blazor-line-chart.png)


#### **How often is data saved in the database.**

I publish the data to Adafruit every 5 seconds, meaning 12 times per minute. The rate limit for the free plan that Adafruit offers is 30 per minute and after that you would receive a throttle warning. The data is saved each time it is published together with a timestamp of that moment..

#### ***Explain your choice of database.**

I personally have not set up a database. Adafruit saves the data for 30 days and you can also download the data if you want

#### ***Automation/triggers of the data.**

There are a couple of different triggers in my code:

Whenever humidity reaches over 70% one of the external LED's turns on and whenever it reaches over 80% it will toggle it, meaning it will give the affect of blinking with each iteration of the loop.

Whenever the gas sensor detects something the other LED will turn on.

The board can also be triggered from the Adafruit dashboard. I have created a toggle button no the dashboards which switches the Pico W onboard LED on or off.

### Finalizing the design

#### **Show the final results of the project**

This was quite a journey! It did not fully turn out as I hoped.

When I started out the project I originally planned to use the ELK stack. I did install Logstash, Elastic Search and Kibana, it was all up and running after the initial installation, but whenever I would shut down for the day - the next day Kibana would be upset and refuse to connect to Elastic (error: "Unable to retrieve version information from Elasticsearch nodes"). I then deleted and reinstalled Kibana upon which it worked - until I would shut it down and try to access it again. After countless of hours trying to fix the issue through the config files I had to admit defeat and the fact that this problem was beyond me.

I then got the idea of setting up my own API and dashboard to handle and visualize the data! Something I got really excited about because I planned to try out a new programming language, namely dotnet, both for API and frontend. I set up the API and successfully made requests via Postman and stored the data in Elastic. Since the Pico and my computer are different entities I could not use localhost and therefor set up a tunnel with serveo.net for the Pico to be able to reach my API. Unfortunately, when trying to make these requests from the Pico to post the real data collected by it, the Pico program would crash with an ENOMEM and I have not been able to solve the issue. I created a fake endpoint via RequestBin to see if it was rather my API that was the problem (although it has been working fine with Postman), I first only sent temperature data to the fake endpoint - that worked, BUT I then tried sending temperature, humidity and airquality (3 requests) to the fake endpoint and then - ENOMEM. I then tried to send only temperature data to my own API, but it seemed the Pico was already upset and now I did not manage to even send a single request neither to my API nor the fake endpoint. This makes me believe that it indeed has something to do with the memory, but during a help session it was me and several TA's trying to solve it without success.

So, when the final week before hand-in layed before me I set up the Adafruit account and dashboard instead. I am dissappointed that the way I tried to challenge myself did not pay off, but Adafruit did the trick and I could at least have a finished solution to submit.

**Edit:**

Just from pure curiousity to try dotnet I went around the problem of getting the data directly from Pico to my API instead I let my API request the data from Adafruit, transform it and then send the necessary values for display in the charts of my front end.
